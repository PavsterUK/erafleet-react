        <h2>Real-time monitoring</h2>
        <span>
          Integrated GPS-powered maps display accurate real-time information for
          a set of vehicles or a specific vehicle in your fleet.
          <br />
          <br /> With EraFleet you can make quick and informed decisions by
          gaining access to such data as: <br />
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Vehicle’s location, including routes travelled during a particular
              period of time which allows you to follow your drivers’ progress
              and adherence to the planned route.
            </li>
            <li>
              Current speed, average speed, speed limits in selected areas and
              where those limits were exceeded by your drivers will help you to
              enforce compliant driver behaviour on the road which may impact
              your company’s reputation and expenditure. These data (including
              data and time) can be displayed for any point of the travelled
              route.
            </li>
            <li>
              Downtime duration and location will enable you to evaluate and
              optimise your planned routes and schedules which will lead to
              increased productivity, improved service and reduced fuel costs.
            </li>

        <h2>Reports and analytics</h2>
        <span>
          Having easy access to summarised vehicle performance data can
          significantly improve essential measurement of operational processes,
          and thus positively impact business growth. EraFleet reports are
          customisable, instantly convertible into charts and integrative of
          different vehicles. The database stores your data for up to a year
          which allows you to run reports comprising both live and historical
          data for any selected time range, number of units and various report
          types. Your selected information is immediately displayed in
          digestible charts and graphs which can be analysed from different
          angles. You can go granular as much as you want as historical data can
          be sorted by any desired time range – from an annual view to a
          specific day. Data obtained from different devices can be easily
          consolidated into one report.

        <h2>Points of interests</h2>
        <span>
          Identifying and defining the most relevant or regularly visited areas
          on the map can increase business efficiency, including customer
          satisfaction. You can create a number of editable Points of Interests
          (POI) representing such operative zones as frequently visited pick up
          and delivery locations, garages and petrol stations.

          Another productive way to optimize a transport-related business is an
          automated schedule of vehicle maintenance. Managing such a schedule
          requires a minimal amount of administrative efforts but can lead to
          reduced losses and costs.
          <br />
          <br /> E-garage features two sections useful to an efficiency-oriented
          transport manager:
          <br />
          <br /> • A tab of automated notifications fed by the tracking devices
          installed in the vehicles. For example, if the device detects that the
          vehicle has a system error or fault, EraFleet system generates a
          garage message and sends an email informing the user of the current
          fault.
          <br />
          <br /> • A tab of events displaying a list of unique instances created
          by the user who can either close, edit or add new ones. For example,
          if a vehicle should have the oil changed after travelling a certain
          number of kilometers (or on a specific day), the user creates a
          unique, descriptive event selecting either a date or odometer as a
          trigger for an email notification.
